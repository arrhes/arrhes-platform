# .dockerignore - Excludes files from Docker build context
# ==============================================================================
# This file prevents unnecessary files from being sent to Docker daemon
# during image builds, speeding up the build process and reducing image size.
#
# Note: Source code is bind-mounted at runtime, not copied during build,
# so this primarily affects base image creation.
